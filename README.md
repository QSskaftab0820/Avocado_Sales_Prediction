# Avocado_Sales_Prediction

This project analyzes avocado sales data to answer key business questions using data visualization and regression modeling.
It identifies trends in price, volume, and regional performance. A Linear Regression model is implemented to predict avocado prices, though results show limited accuracy due to minimal price variation across records.
